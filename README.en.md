## Overview

iLab GPT Conjure is an AI image generation WebUI workbench for GPT-image-2, with
a companion CLI for local automation. It supports the default Codex Image
channel, a Codex Responses compatibility channel, and OpenAI-compatible API
access, and includes shared gallery references, multi-type quick chips, prompt
templates, concurrent tasks, a paged history library, and local queue
management.

The recommended public integration path is OpenAI-compatible API mode, using
the Images API or Responses API shape provided by your configured provider.

Download standard app packages and portable transition packages from
[Downloads / Releases](RELEASES.md).

## Features

- GPT-image-2 text-to-image, reference-image generation, and image editing
  workflows.
- Codex Image, Codex Responses, and OpenAI-compatible API access, with the API
  path recommended for public or shared use.
- Concurrent task execution, local queue state, paged history library,
  thumbnails, and result archive.
- Independent `/history` page with SQLite-backed pagination, search, filters,
  grid/list views, and lazy detail loading.
- Optional web search for Codex Responses and API Responses image generation,
  plus prompt and task ID search across recent and historical tasks.
- Shared gallery references, recent reference images, color chips, prompt
  snippet chips, and reusable prompt templates.
- Layered input-image editor with inserted input images, multi-image
  composition, default ratio-locked transform, Shift free transform, local
  erasing, and real layer thumbnails.
- System Settings language dropdown for Simplified Chinese, Traditional
  Chinese, Japanese, Korean, English, Spanish, Portuguese, French, German,
  Russian, Italian, and Hindi, with first-launch browser detection and a
  browser-local language preference.
- Centered System Settings with API Settings, Codex Channel, a discoverable
  Language tab, and Storage & Notifications tabs.
- API provider cards for fast selection, read-only details by default, explicit
  editing, provider copy, delete confirmation, and multi-provider sorting.
- Standard macOS DMG and Windows App ZIP packages with a rabbit tray/menu-bar
  launcher, Open WebUI / Settings / History Library actions, system-language
  menu labels, native About window, and confirmed legacy portable data copy on
  first launch.
- Portable transition packages keep local `data/` next to the app and support
  user-confirmed automatic replacement through the signed `latest.json`
  manifest, Ed25519 signature verification, SHA256 checks, `.backup/`, and
  launcher restart.
- Advanced local OAuth mode for personal Codex workflows, with clear risk
  warnings and no account-usage probing.
- API provider profiles with configurable base URL, API key, image model, API
  mode, and concurrency.
- CLI support for generation, image references, image edits, masks, and dry runs.

## Authentication modes

### Recommended: OpenAI-compatible API

Use this mode for stable integrations, shared workstations, team deployments, or
anything that may become a public service. Configure the provider in the WebUI
with a base URL, API key, model name, and API mode.

### Advanced local mode: Codex / ChatGPT OAuth

This project can optionally reuse a local Codex / ChatGPT OAuth session to call
internal ChatGPT backend endpoints. Codex mode defaults to the direct Image
channel for generation and editing, and the System Settings Codex Channel tab
can switch it to the Responses compatibility channel. This mode is provided for
local personal workflows only.

It is not an officially recommended OpenAI API integration path. The endpoint
may change without notice, may stop working, and may be subject to account,
product, or usage restrictions. For stable integrations, production usage,
shared deployments, or public services, use OpenAI-compatible API mode instead.

Never commit OAuth files, API keys, local inputs, generated outputs, task
metadata, SQLite databases, or debug logs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.11 or newer.
- WebUI dependencies from `requirements-webui.txt`.
- Optional frontend tooling from `package.json` when editing TypeScript or CSS.

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kadevin/ilab-gpt-conjure.git
cd ilab-gpt-conjure
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/python -m pip install -r requirements-webui.txt
```

## Start the WebUI

macOS:

```bash
open "Start WebUI.command"
```

Windows:

```text
Start WebUI.bat
```

Manual:

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m uvicorn codex_image.webui.app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8787 --no-access-log
```

Then open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8787/
```

## App packages

Download the current packages from [Downloads / Releases](RELEASES.md), or open
[GitHub Release v0.5.7](https://github.com/kadevin/ilab-gpt-conjure/releases/tag/v0.5.7)
directly.

New users should choose the standard packages:

1. macOS: download `iLab-GPT-CONJURE-macos-arm64-0.5.7.dmg`
   for Apple Silicon or `iLab-GPT-CONJURE-macos-x64-0.5.7.dmg`
   for Intel, then drag `iLab GPT CONJURE.app` to Applications.
2. Windows: download `iLab-GPT-CONJURE-windows-x64_0.5.7.zip`,
   extract it into a normal user directory, and run `iLab GPT CONJURE.exe`.

Standard packages store user data in `~/Library/Application Support/iLab GPT
CONJURE` on macOS and `%APPDATA%\iLab GPT CONJURE` on Windows. On first launch,
the app can detect adjacent legacy portable data and asks before copying it. The
old `data/` folder is not moved or deleted, and existing standard data is never
overwritten automatically.

v0.5.4 and earlier portable users should manually download a full standard package or a full portable package for the first 0.5.5 upgrade. The old updater only guarantees WebUI/dependency updates and may not install the new rabbit launcher, standard `.app` / `.exe` entry, or migration assistant.

Portable packages remain available for old users, debugging, and users who want
a ComfyUI-style unzip-and-run experience:

1. Download the portable zip for your platform from the release page.
2. Extract it into a normal user directory.
3. Run `Start iLab GPT CONJURE.exe` on Windows, or double-click
   `Start iLab GPT CONJURE.app` on macOS. The legacy
   `Start WebUI Portable.bat` / `Start WebUI Portable.command` scripts remain
   available for terminal-based troubleshooting.
4. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` if the browser does not open automatically.

The portable package contains bundled CPython, installed WebUI dependencies,
prebuilt static WebUI assets, frontend package metadata/build config for source
rebuilds, the app source, license files, and a local `data/` directory for
settings, gallery files, inputs, outputs, task databases, and logs.

Portable startup launchers do not run `npm install` or rebuild frontend assets.
Node.js is only needed if you intentionally edit TypeScript or CSS and rebuild
the static WebUI assets from source.

Portable startup launchers do not contact GitHub automatically. To update an
extracted portable package, choose Check for Updates from the tray/menu-bar menu
and confirm Install Update, or quit the launcher and run
`Update WebUI Portable.bat` on Windows / `Update WebUI Portable.command` on
macOS manually.
The updater reads the published signed `latest.json` manifest, verifies its
Ed25519 signature with the launcher public key, downloads the latest matching
GitHub Release asset, prints the selected asset and manifest SHA256 before
making changes, verifies the downloaded zip against that SHA256, preserves
`data/`, only replaces package-managed files inside the portable folder, and
saves replaced files under `.backup/`.

Choose `macos_portable_arm64` for Apple Silicon Macs and
`macos_portable_x64` for Intel Macs.

The standard macOS DMG and macOS portable zips are unsigned and not notarized.
If macOS blocks the app after download, right-click or Control-click the
app, choose Open, then confirm Open again in the macOS security prompt. For
portable zips, you can also remove quarantine from the extracted folder:

```bash
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/ilab-gpt-conjure_macos_portable_arm64
# or:
xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /path/to/ilab-gpt-conjure_macos_portable_x64
```

Do not commit portable package contents back to Git. API keys, OAuth files,
local inputs, generated outputs, SQLite databases, and logs must stay local.

Release packaging is intentionally separate from CI: the `Portable Release`
workflow runs only after the `CI` workflow has completed successfully on a push
to `main`, then builds standard packages, portable packages, and SHA256 files as
workflow artifacts. If the commit is tagged with a `v*` tag, the release job
also builds signed `latest.json` using the
`ILAB_CONJURE_UPDATE_SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY_B64` secret and uploads all packages,
SHA256 files, and the update manifest to that GitHub Release. For a tagged
commit that already passed CI, the same workflow can also be run manually with
`ref` and `release_tag`.

## WebUI usage

1. Choose an authentication source from the top bar. `Codex` uses the default
   Image channel when local OAuth is available, and `API` is the recommended
   OpenAI-compatible mode for stable or shared use.
2. Open System Settings to manage API provider cards, Codex Image/Responses
   mode, interface language, storage paths, and notification preferences.
3. Add reference images by upload, drag-and-drop, paste, recent uploads, or the
   public gallery.
4. Write the prompt directly, insert gallery/color/snippet chips when useful,
   and choose the prompt mode: original, fidelity, or creative.
5. Set image count, size, orientation, quality, output format, and compression.
   Selected aspect ratios are also appended to the model prompt as an explicit
   instruction, for example `将宽高比设为 16:9`, so Responses-channel or API
   proxies that ignore size parameters can still receive the intended ratio.
6. Start generation, track running and queued tasks in the left task list, then
   review, select, retry, download, or archive results from the preview area.

## Public gallery

The public gallery is a local reusable reference library for people, characters,
products, brand assets, style references, and any image you want to reuse.

- Save uploaded images, recent uploads, or generated results into the gallery.
- Manage images in the right-side gallery drawer with categories, names, prompt
  roles, reference notes, replacement images, deletion, and drag sorting.
- Insert a gallery image into the current task from the gallery drawer or by
  typing `@` in the prompt editor.
- Gallery files stay local. Do not commit `input/`, `inputs/`, `output/`, or
  `outputs/`. If a gallery item is later deleted, older tasks may show a missing
  reference.

## Prompt chips

The prompt editor supports three atomic chip types:

- `@` gallery chip: searches the public gallery, inserts the selected image into
  reference inputs, and adds visible reference notes for the model.
- `#` color chip: inserts a hexadecimal color value such as `#FF6600`; useful
  for product, poster, brand, material, or background color constraints.
- `~` snippet chip: inserts a saved prompt snippet by short tag. The editor keeps
  the short tag visible, while the model prompt expands it to the full snippet
  content.

Snippet chips can be created from selected prompt text and can later be viewed,
expanded into plain text, edited, or reused with `~`, `～`, or common tilde
variants.

## Prompt templates

Prompt templates are for longer reusable prompt structures, not short inline
phrases. They are stored locally in `output/webui-prompt-templates.json`.

Use `Manage Prompt Templates` in the prompt area to search, filter by category,
favorite, create, edit, copy, insert, replace, import, or export templates.
Templates can use small thumbnails from historical results as visual cues.

Inserting a template writes into the visible prompt editor. Replacing a template
overwrites the visible prompt text. Templates are not injected as hidden prompts.

## CLI

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m codex_image generate --prompt "A clean product photo of a ceramic mug" --out output/mug.png
```

Use `--help` for all CLI options.

## Development

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
npm run check:webui
```

When changing frontend TypeScript or CSS, run `npm install` first. This installs
the frontend build dependencies pinned by `package-lock.json`, including Konva
for the layered input-image editor. Commit the generated browser assets in
`codex_image/webui/static/`.

GitHub CI runs the Python test suite and WebUI frontend checks on pull requests
and pushes to `main`. Release packaging should run only after CI succeeds.
