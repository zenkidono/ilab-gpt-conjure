# Windows Portable Package

This package is intended for Windows x64 users who want to unzip and run the
WebUI without installing Python separately.

## How to use

1. Extract the zip package into a normal user directory, for example
   `D:\Apps\ilab-gpt-conjure`.
2. Double-click `Start iLab GPT CONJURE.exe` for the system tray launcher, or
   `Start WebUI Portable.bat` for the legacy terminal launcher.
3. Open `http://127.0.0.1:8787/` if the browser does not open automatically.
4. Choose `Codex` if this machine has a local Codex / ChatGPT OAuth session, or
   configure an OpenAI-compatible API provider in the WebUI for the recommended
   stable integration path.

The Rust system tray launcher starts the local WebUI server without a separate
terminal window, opens the browser, and keeps a rabbit icon in the Windows
notification area. Its menu can open the WebUI, check published updates, show
project info, restart the service, or quit. It does not contact GitHub
automatically; the check action only runs when you choose it from the menu. It
can start the bundled updater after you confirm an available update. The updater
downloads and verifies the matching zip, preserves `data/`, replaces
package-managed files, and restarts the tray launcher. You can also quit the
launcher and run `Update WebUI Portable.bat` manually.

## Directory layout

- `Start iLab GPT CONJURE.exe`: system tray launcher with the rabbit icon.
- `Start WebUI Portable.bat`: legacy one-click terminal launcher.
- `Update WebUI Portable.bat`: one-click updater for the latest GitHub Release
  manifest entry matching Windows x64.
- `app/`: iLab GPT Conjure source code, prebuilt static WebUI assets, and
  frontend package metadata/build config for source rebuilds.
- `python/`: embedded CPython runtime and installed WebUI dependencies.
- `data/`: local settings, gallery files, inputs, outputs, queue database, and
  logs created while using the app.

The portable startup launcher does not run `npm install` or rebuild frontend
assets. Node.js is only needed if you intentionally edit TypeScript or CSS and
rebuild `app/codex_image/webui/static/app.js` from source.

## Security notes

Do not put API keys, OAuth tokens, private prompts, input images, outputs, task
databases, or logs into GitHub issues or public repositories.

OpenAI-compatible API mode is the recommended stable integration path. The
optional Codex / ChatGPT OAuth mode defaults to the Codex Image channel for
personal local workflows only; it can be switched to the Responses compatibility
channel in API settings, but it is not an officially recommended OpenAI API
integration path.

## Upgrading

Choose `Check for Updates` from the system tray launcher. If a newer signed
release manifest is available, confirm `Install Update`; the launcher will hand
off to the bundled updater, quit itself, and let the updater replace package
files and restart the tray app.

You can also quit the system tray launcher, close any WebUI server window, then
double-click `Update WebUI Portable.bat` manually.
The updater reads the published signed `latest.json` manifest, verifies its
Ed25519 signature with the launcher public key, then prints the current version,
latest version, selected release asset, manifest SHA256, and download URL before
making changes. It downloads the latest Windows x64 portable package from
GitHub Releases, verifies the manifest SHA256, replaces only the package-managed
app, launcher, and bundled Python files inside this portable folder, and
preserves the existing `data/` directory. A backup of replaced files is saved
under `.backup/`.

If your local PowerShell policy blocks the updater, run it from a trusted local
PowerShell session according to your organization or device policy.

Do not move `data/` out of the package unless you are intentionally migrating
settings, gallery assets, history, outputs, and local task databases. For a
manual upgrade, extract the new package next to the old one and copy the old
`data/` directory into the new package.
